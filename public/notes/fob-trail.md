A few notes about Fall Out Boy Trail
- Normally, America's Suitehearts (regular) would play at the beginning, but all the audio files were lost for this game (blame Warner) and this was the only version I had on me.
- Yes, the music quality is horrible. Sorry :)
- I edited a few of the links to point to more 'modern' places. falloutboyband.com and the iTunes links were changed to point to falloutboy.com and Spotify.
- Yes, Sugar, We're Going Down is on From Under the Cork Tree.
- Thanks For The Memories. (i'm sorry)
